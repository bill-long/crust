/**
 * Self-healing recovery for Rust crypto initialization.
 *
 * `initRustCrypto` can fail in two ways that the user cannot recover from on
 * their own:
 *   1. It rejects (e.g. a corrupt or partially-written IndexedDB crypto store
 *      left behind by an earlier failed init).
 *   2. It hangs forever (a half-initialized store can leave the open call
 *      pending with no resolution), leaving the app stuck on
 *      "Initializing encryption…".
 *
 * We cannot clear the store in-process while a hung init still holds an
 * IndexedDB connection — `indexedDB.deleteDatabase` would block on the open
 * connection. A full page reload tears down the hung call and its connection,
 * so recovery is staged across reloads and tracked in `sessionStorage`:
 *
 *   null    → first attempt. On failure: reload once (handles transient hangs
 *             without destroying keys).
 *   reload  → second attempt after a plain reload. On failure: the store is
 *             likely corrupt, so escalate to "clear" and reload again.
 *   clear   → next load wipes the Matrix SDK + Rust crypto stores before
 *             re-initializing (safe: no init is in flight on a fresh load).
 *             On failure: give up and surface the error banner.
 *
 * Staging is bounded (null → reload → clear → error), so it can never loop.
 *
 * Tradeoff: the "clear" stage is reached after any two consecutive init
 * failures, including repeated timeouts — we deliberately do NOT gate it on a
 * specific corruption error, because the original failure mode is a hang that
 * never rejects with a recognizable message. The wipe is destructive (it
 * resets this device's crypto identity and drops room keys that are not in key
 * backup), but it is the only way to heal a corrupt or hung store, and it only
 * fires after a plain reload has already failed to recover. Users with key
 * backup configured have their room keys restored automatically afterward; the
 * actionable encryption banner routes everyone else to set up secure messaging.
 *
 * The persisted stage is scoped to the logged-in identity so that a stale
 * stage left by a previous account can never trigger a destructive store wipe
 * for a different account logged in later in the same tab.
